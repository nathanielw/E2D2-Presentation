						[Intro]
						...and I've been working on the Expeditee Desktop.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So Expeditee is a hypermedia enviroment for creating and organising various types of content.</p>
						
						<p>Its primary use would be for things such as note-taking, but it aims to support a wide range of activities.</p>

						<p>It provides quite a unique style of interaction, but at the same time feels quite outdated visually, so switching between it and other desktop programs can sometimes be a little jarring.</p>
						
						<p>The aim of this project was to expand Expeditee so that its core features could be used across an entire modern desktop environment.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The platform that was chosen for this was Android, <small>which can be installed on any computer using Android x86, or just used on a tablet, which, with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, is perfect place to be using Expeditee.</small></p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The possibility of modify and compiling up a custom version of Android was breifly explored, and while this was surprisingly straight forward, it would obviously not be the best approach for end-users.</p>
						
						<p>Instead I switched over to creating a standard Android app that, provided the user has root access, makes the necessary changes, without permanently modifying any of the Android system. This was achieved through a really cool framework called Xposed, which handles all the hard work of injecting the changes at boot.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The end result of this was that across the Android system, the text content of elements that extend Android’s standard Text or Button UI elements text can be picked up with a right click and carried between apps, with text entry fields allowing the same mouse button combos you’d use in Expeditee for manipulating text.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The second part of the project consisted of porting the main Expeditee app to Android.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The Expeditee codebase has no real separation between graphics and logic code, so I had to make some significate changes to its structure...</p>
						<p>The code that the Android version is running on has been structured so that the user interface is completely separate from the logic, which means, in theory, the desktop version could be modified to be running of a common codebase.</p> <!-- TODO: condense these paragraphs -->
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>At the moment only basic viewing and navigation is supported in the app, so there's still a lot that could be added in the future, including editing, integration with the first part of the project and potentially other Android-specific features.
